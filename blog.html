            <h4><span class="fw-bold">Question 01:</span> Write down the difference between 'Local Storage' and 'Session Storage'.</h4>

            <p class="text-muted my-3"> <span class="fw-bold">Answer: </span> <br><span class="fw-bold">Local Storage: </span>  Local storage maintains data across all instances of a site, whether they're in different tabs or windows. It is also permanent, so the data won't disappear when you close your browser.

            When you open a website that previously used local storage, it will always have access to that stored data.
            
            As a web developer, you can use this mechanism to retain data about a user. Some websites might use this to keep you logged in or provide a more personalized experience.
            
            <br> <br> <span class="fw-bold">Sesson Storage: </span>: A browsing session approximates your use of a website. If you visit a site, browse around for a bit, then turn off your computer, you can think of that time as a single session. Your browser configuration may change this in subtle ways, but a session aims to represent the chunk of time you interact with a site.

            Session storage is unique to each browser tab. If you open a new tab and navigate to the same site, you'll start a new session with its own storage. However, if you use a "duplicate tab" feature in your browser, that may reuse the same session. You can't rely too much on the specific details of a "session". Instead, focus on the core concept: session storage is temporary.  </p>

            <h4><span class="fw-bold">Question 02:</span> Write down the difference between 'Global Scope' and 'Block Scope'.</h4>

            <p class="text-muted my-3"> <span class="fw-bold">Answer: </span> <br><span class="fw-bold">Global Scope: </span>  The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.


                
            <br> <br> <span class="fw-bold">Sesson Storage: </span>: Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

           <div class="third-que pt-5">

            <h4><span class="fw-bold">Question 03:</span> Write down JavaScript 'Event Loop'.</h4>

            <p class="text-muted my-3"> <span class="fw-bold">Answer: </span> <br><span class="fw-bold">JavaScript Event Loop: </span>  The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading. Let’s take a look at what happens on the back-end. <br>

            The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed. Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack. <br>
            
            
            The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution.
